We can easily convert this problem using binary encoding

FBFBBFFRLR => We replace F with 0,B with 1 and L with 0 and R with 1

0101100 101 == 357 in decimal,which is the required seat id

We can use for loop to convert a binary to decimal:
decimal = 0
for digit in binary:
    decimal = decimal*2 + int(digit)
print decimal

Or we can use builtin functions,i.e,
int(x , base = 2)
